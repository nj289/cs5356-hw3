            <p>The above image was generated with ChatGPT. Instead of creating a bio for an individual, I'm centering this webpage on Trust & Safety (T&S) because
                I'm taking a fascinating course about it and interviewing for T&S internships at the moment.
                All of us interact with T&S features and interventions in our use of digital platforms like Instagram, X, Google,
                and even apps like Strava or Spotify. These serve a number of purposes, such as ensuring that users do not encounter
